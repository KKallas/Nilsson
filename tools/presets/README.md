# Presets

Save, load, import, and export automation presets. A preset is a folder containing workflows, tools, and a manifest that packages a complete automation solution.

```
.nilsson/presets/<name>/
  preset.json       — manifest (name, description, version, dependencies)
  workflows/        — workflow folders included in this preset
  tools/            — tool scripts included in this preset
```
